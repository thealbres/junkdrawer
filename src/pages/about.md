    <p>Just a dev who loves building things that actually scale. Currently vibe-coding my way through backend architectures and chasing fresh ideas in the AI space.</p>

## What's the deal with this blog?

This is my **junk drawer**. A place where I dump random thoughts, technical rabbit holes, and whatever else I'm currently obsessed with. 

- 🔥 **High-scale everything**: If it doesn't handle a billion requests, is it even fun?
- 📚 **Architecture Nerd**: Grasping the ocean of software design.
- 🤖 **AI Tinkering**: GenAI/LLMs — because the future is weird and exciting.
- 🏄 **Go \& Go**: My current language of choice for building the next big thing.

I build what excites me and push most of it to the cloud.

*Minimalism is cool, but junk drawers are where the real treasure is.*
